Assignment Response

1. A time I shared a personal struggle with a coworker:
I once shared with a teammate that I was feeling overwhelmed managing both client expectations and backend development tasks. It wasn’t too difficult because we had worked closely before and built mutual trust. I felt relieved after the conversation.

2. What I learned from this lesson that could have helped:
This lesson taught me the importance of emotional intelligence and timing. Back then, I didn’t consider if it was a good time for them to listen. Understanding how to frame my concern better would’ve made it more productive for both of us.

3. A time I felt intimidated while sharing (imagined):
Imagine I shared that I was struggling with imposter syndrome during a team call, and the listener didn’t respond supportively. If they had acknowledged my feelings, maintained eye contact, or followed up later, it would’ve helped me feel safer and valued.

4. Ways I can improve sharing at work:

I will choose one-on-one conversations for personal topics instead of group settings.

I’ll frame my struggles constructively, focusing on growth and solutions rather than just venting.
