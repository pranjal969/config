My Response (Prompt 1: EJ and Elijah)

As someone who has worked in a technical team where managers didn’t always have hands-on experience with the tools we used, I believe the key for EJ is to approach Elijah with humility and respect, while still reinforcing the leadership dynamic.

EJ could say something like, “Elijah, I know you have a strong handle on this new software, and I’d really appreciate it if you could walk me through its key features. It’ll help me make better decisions about how we roll it out in the store.” This shows respect for Elijah’s skills and positions the request as a collaborative opportunity.

In my experience, employees like Elijah often feel more motivated when their expertise is recognized. EJ should also make it clear that he values Elijah’s input in making the software a success—not just for the sales, but for the team’s workflow as well.

Maintaining the manager-employee relationship here depends on clear boundaries. EJ can be open to learning, but still lead by showing that he’s committed to the store’s success and team development.

By treating Elijah as a subject matter expert without undermining his own role, EJ can build trust and strengthen the team
