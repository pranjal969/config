1. What did you research?
I recently researched Generative AI’s impact on knowledge work.


2. What were you trying to accomplish?
I wanted to understand how AI can enhance productivity in consulting, content creation, and customer service while identifying potential risks (like bias and misuse).


3. How did you do it?
I started by reviewing reports from McKinsey and Deloitte on AI adoption in enterprises. I also read academic papers from arXiv and case studies from real-world deployments. I supplemented this with a few YouTube lectures and blog posts from leading AI practitioners.


4. Any tips for us?
Look for a mix of reputable consulting reports and hands-on case studies. Consulting reports provide strategic insights, while case studies highlight practical challenges and best practices. Also, try to get different perspectives—sometimes industry blogs or YouTube talks add a more pragmatic viewpoint than purely academic papers.
