Reflecting on Elevator Pitches and Emotional Elements

An elevator pitch is a concise, compelling way to share an idea, product, or concept in a short amount of time. The emotional elements embedded in an elevator pitch can make it resonate with the listener — or cause it to backfire.

Emotional Elements: Help or Hurt?

When done right, emotion adds authenticity and energy to a pitch. For example, showing genuine enthusiasm or sharing a brief, relevant anecdote makes the listener more engaged and receptive. It can humanize the pitch, build rapport, and help the speaker stand out.

However, too much emotion — or the wrong type — can be off-putting. If the speaker comes across as overly dramatic, desperate, or too aggressive, the listener may lose interest or feel uncomfortable. It’s also important that the emotional tone matches the context. For instance, a pitch about a technical product might benefit from measured excitement rather than over-the-top enthusiasm.

Emotions are most helpful when they align naturally with the speaker’s passion for the product or idea. For example, pitching a health-related app to a group of doctors might involve sharing a brief personal story about a health challenge and how the app could have made a difference. That connection can turn a generic sales pitch into a relatable conversation.

A Time I Responded Well to an Elevator Pitch

One instance that comes to mind was when a friend asked me to explain the differences between two project management tools—Jira and Trello. Instead of rattling off features, I framed my response in terms of how each tool made me feel when I used them. I explained that Jira felt robust but sometimes overwhelming, like a big corporate dashboard, while Trello felt intuitive and lightweight, like a flexible to-do list. I could see that my friend immediately connected with the Trello analogy and asked more questions about it.

What I remember most is that I spoke conversationally, using real-world comparisons and sharing how I personally experienced the tools. My tone was genuine, not robotic. I avoided technical jargon unless it was helpful, and I paused to let my friend ask questions.

Pointers for Next Time

Next time, I’d make sure to:

Start with a clear, relatable hook or story that builds connection.

Match the level of detail to the listener’s familiarity with the topic.

Maintain a confident but natural tone, showing authentic passion without overwhelming the listener.

Use emotion judiciously to enhance, not overshadow, the key message.


Ultimately, the best elevator pitches are those that feel like a conversation, not a monologue, and that combine emotional authenticity with concise clarity.
