My Response (Prompt 1):

A few months ago, I was juggling multiple responsibilities at work—tight deadlines, backend bugs, client escalations—and on top of that, I was preparing for backend developer interviews. The pressure was intense, and I started feeling burned out. I was mentally drained, and I just needed someone to understand that I wasn’t okay.

One day, during a coffee break, I opened up to a coworker I trust. I told him that I felt like I was falling short in both my job and my goals. To my surprise, he didn’t offer quick advice or try to “fix” the situation. He just listened. He acknowledged how tough it must be and shared that he had felt similarly in his past role.

That moment of empathy changed a lot for me. It reminded me I wasn’t alone, and that even competent, hardworking people go through tough phases. I felt lighter just knowing someone understood without judgment.

It made me realize how powerful genuine compassion is in the workplace. That one moment helped me recover faster and approach my work with a more balanced mindset.

Now, I try to offer that same space to others when I sense they need it—even if it’s just to say, “I hear you.”
