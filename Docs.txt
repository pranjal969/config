One of the most compelling speeches I’ve heard is Steve Jobs’ 2005 Stanford Commencement Address. This speech resonates deeply with me because it’s rich in pathos, logos, and ethos—elements that together create a truly persuasive and memorable message.

Pathos (Emotional Appeal):
Jobs starts with the story of his adoption and his decision to drop out of college. He speaks about feeling lost but trusting that the dots would connect someday. This vulnerability makes the speech instantly relatable, especially for someone like me who has also felt uncertain about my own path. His account of being fired from Apple and later finding a new sense of purpose at NeXT and Pixar struck an emotional chord—it reminded me that setbacks can lead to growth and new opportunities. The most powerful moment of pathos, though, comes when he shares his experience with cancer. His reminder that “your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life” hit me hard, stirring both reflection and motivation.

Logos (Logical Appeal):
Jobs logically lays out the idea that one cannot connect the dots looking forward, only backward. This idea is supported by his own life story, showing that trust and perseverance are crucial even when the path ahead seems unclear. He also logically argues for the importance of doing work that you love, emphasizing that passion fuels resilience and innovation. These points are grounded in reason and his personal experience, making them logically persuasive.

Ethos (Credibility and Character):
Jobs’ ethos is undeniable. He speaks as the co-founder of Apple, a highly respected innovator and entrepreneur. His reputation adds immense weight to his words, but more importantly, his willingness to share personal failures alongside successes makes him even more credible. His authenticity—acknowledging his own doubts and struggles—builds trust with the audience.

Connection to My Values and Interests:
As someone deeply interested in technology and personal growth, Jobs’ speech aligns closely with my own values. His emphasis on following your intuition and passion speaks to my desire for a meaningful career. His message to embrace failure and learn from it encourages me to view my own setbacks not as dead ends but as stepping stones to growth.

What It Persuaded Me To Do:
This speech persuaded me to take risks and trust that things will work out in the end—even when the path is uncertain. It encouraged me to pursue work that truly excites me rather than settling for something that feels safe. Most importantly, it persuaded me to cherish time and live authentically, because “your time is limited.”

Overall, Steve Jobs’ 2005 Stanford Commencement Address exemplifies the power of persuasive speaking—combining emotional storytelling, logical reasoning, and credible authority to inspire action and change.
