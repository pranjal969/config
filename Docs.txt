"Mastering the Art of Effective Email Communication"


---

Notes for Improvement (after reviewing the first recording):

✅ Pacing and Clarity:
I noticed that I spoke a bit too quickly in some sections, especially when discussing email etiquette and tone. Next time, I’ll slow down to ensure the audience can follow along and understand each point clearly.

✅ Visual Aids:
I didn’t use enough visuals or examples (like screenshots or a sample email). For the second recording, I plan to include a slide deck with key points and a sample email to make the presentation more engaging and easier to follow.

✅ Body Language and Eye Contact:
I tended to look down at my notes too often, which could reduce audience engagement. Next time, I’ll practice maintaining better eye contact with the camera and use natural gestures to emphasize key points.

✅ Conclusion and Call-to-Action:
I didn’t wrap up the presentation with a clear summary or a call-to-action. I’ll revise the ending to reinforce the key takeaways and encourage the audience to apply the email communication skills right away.
