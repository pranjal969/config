Internal Biases:

I sometimes over-rely on familiar technologies even when better options exist.

I may unintentionally overlook quieter team members during discussions.

I tend to take on too much responsibility rather than delegating.

I can be overly critical of others' coding styles if they don’t match my own.

3. Areas I Want to Work On:

Letting go of control and trusting the team with more responsibilities.

Actively encouraging input from all team members, not just the vocal ones.

Becoming more comfortable with change and experimenting with new tools.

Learning to give feedback in a way that’s constructive, not critical.

Improving my communication with non-technical stakeholders.

4. Evaluation of My Managerial Skill Set:

My strengths lie in task management, technical mentoring, and delivery ownership. However, I need to improve my emotional intelligence, adaptability, and team empowerment. These soft skills are just as important as technical skills in effective leadership.

5. Ways I Can Improve as a Manager:

Practice active listening and encourage diverse viewpoints in meetings.

Take short courses on emotional intelligence and conflict management.

Delegate more and build a stronger sense of ownership within the team.

Join a community of tech leads or managers to learn from peers.

Keep a weekly journal to reflect on leadership decisions and lessons.

6. My Preferred Managerial Style to Work Under:

I prefer to work under a coaching-style manager who:

Supports learning and growth.

Offers regular feedback and mentorship.

Encourages autonomy but is available when needed.

Leads with empathy and clear communication.
